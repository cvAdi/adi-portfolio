                As a mechanical engineering graduate with a grade of 6.7, I transitioned into the IT industry and
                pursued a career as a  &nbsp;<b><em>frontend developer</em></b>. Since graduating in 2020, I have accumulated three
                years of experience in frontend development, honing my skills in <b>JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery,
                  MongoDB, Oracle SQL, and project management using agile methodology and Jira </b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey into frontend development has been characterized by a strong foundation in problem-solving,
                critical thinking, and attention to detail, attributes that I cultivated during my mechanical
                engineering education. This background has allowed me to approach frontend development with a methodical
                and analytical mindset, ensuring efficient and effective solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my role as a &nbsp;<b><em>frontend developer</em></b>&nbsp; I have contributed to various projects, leveraging my
                expertise in frontend technologies to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces. My proficiency in
                JavaScript, HTML, and CSS enables me to build dynamic web applications that meet both functional and
                aesthetic requirements. Additionally, my experience with jQuery has enhanced my ability to implement
                interactive features and enhance user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, my knowledge of backend technologies such as MongoDB and Oracle SQL has provided me with a
                holistic understanding of web development, allowing me to collaborate effectively with backend teams and
                contribute to full-stack development projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, my familiarity with project management methodologies, particularly agile methodology, has
                enabled me to work efficiently within cross-functional teams, prioritize tasks effectively, and deliver
                projects on time.<b> I am adept at utilizing Jira for task tracking, issue management, and project
                  planning, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the development process</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, my journey from mechanical engineering to frontend development has equipped me with a diverse
                skill set, a problem-solving mindset, and a strong foundation in project management, making me a
                valuable asset in the IT industry.
